# Example

## Android

The Example Android App can be built and installed via [Android Studio], or via command line by executing:

```shell
./gradlew installDebug
```

## iOS

The iOS project is generated via:

```shell
./gradlew generateXcodeProject
```

> [!TIP]
> `./gradlew openXcode` can be used to both generate the project _and_ open it in Xcode.

In Xcode, configure signing, then run.
